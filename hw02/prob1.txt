This past week we covered norms. In particular we covered properties of norms
such as homogeneity and the triangle inequality as well as different kinds of
norms like the l-infinity norm and the l2 norm. Norms are relevant because they
provide us with a notion of distance, in Euclidean space that we encouter in
everyday life the l2 norm is commonly used. The l1 norm is also useful since it
is used to measure distances along streets, which can be seen as a grid.

We also covered inner products and their properties. The inner product let's us
think about angles and directions of elements in vector spaces. Induced norms
are defined with respect to the inner products and have many useful properties
such as the Pythagorean Theorem and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Direction is
a powerful concept that inner products give to a space and allows discussion on
orthogonality. Using these fundamental linear algebra ideas such as norms and
inner products, along with spans of linear spaces and basis vectors, gives us
the machinery to formulate systems of linear equations on higher dimensions.
This in turn allows us to solve a variety of linear problems, such as
linear approximation as well as minimization problems, which can be useful for
fitting a particular model to a dataset.
