Problem 2

This past week we have discussed many forms of interpolation.
Polynomial interpolation gives us a simple machinery to fit a mathematical
model, a polynomial in this case, for a series of datapoints. Lagrange
polynomials provide M polynomial basis functions to fit data of M + 1
points without having to solve a linear system of equations, as the polynomial
fit is unique under this condition. Trigonometric polynomials can also be used
for interpolation and the infinite degree trigonometric polynomial is known as
the Fourier Series, which has seen use in many different fields for fitting data
and approximating functions as sum of sinusoids. Splines are a useful tool that
can provide a higher fidelity fit, as they fit inidividual polynomials on the
data intervals. They also ensure the stability of the fit by considering the
derivatives at the points where the individual polynomials intersect.

Interpolation is a very useful and practical tool. During my undergrad aerospace
labs, we would use linear and quadratic polynomial interpolations to estimate
system parameters. Given a physics derived model of lift/drag forces and
velocity, these parameters would be determined based on a polynomial fitted on
the data obtained from experiments. Another use of interpolation is in the
domain of trajectory generation. Often times you have a set of high level
waypoints, but to generate a smooth upsampled sequence of points so that a
controller can track the trajectory requires the use of spline interpolation.
