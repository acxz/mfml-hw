This week we introduced probability, reviewing basic concepts such as
expectation, variance and their properties. We slo covered CDFs and PDFs.
Random variables are decribed with cumulative density functions and their
probability for a given value is specified with the derivative of the cdf, the
probability density function.

A big concept we covered was the weak law of large numbers (WLLN). The WLLN
allows us explain that a set of random numbers can converge as the set grows.
Intuitively this means that if I have a large set of random numbers, I can
appropriately determine the probability of an event.

We also covered Gaussian distributions and their properties, particularly the
fact that a random variable equal to a linear combination of random variables
characterized by a Gaussian pdf is also a Gaussian pdf.
Gaussian distributions are often seen in robotics problems, because of these
properties that make them easier to work with.
