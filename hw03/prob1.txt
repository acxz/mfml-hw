Problem 1

This past week we have discussed orthonormal basis, or in other words,
orthobasis. An orthobasis is a basis for a space where <vi, vj> = 1 if i = j and
= 0 if i =/= j. An important application of representing a span basis as an orthobasis is the
ability to treat inner products on Hilbert spaces as dot products on Euclidean
space (Parseval's Theorem). This gives us a coefficient representation of elements in Hilbert spaces
and lets us manipulate infinite dimensional objects like functions in an
intuitive way. This property is examplified when performing linear approximations,
i.e. approximating functions that can be represented with a known set of basis
functions. This gives us a very powerful technique of data fitting, one of the
biggest concepts we are learning in this class.
